# CathGnuplot
## A C++ interface to Gnuplot

Gnuplot is a command-line program that can generate 2D/3D plots of functions, data, and data fits. It is frequently used for publication-quality graphics as well as education. The program runs on all major computers and operating systems (GNU/Linux, Unix, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and others).

CathGnuplot is an interface allows Gnuplot to be controlled from C++. Essentially, CathGnuplot uses iostream pipes to Gnuplot that enable C++ users to directly pass commands to Gnuplot command-line.

CathGnuplot provides lots of high level functions including lots of useful operations/calculations in Computational Geometry (such as Convex Hull), which are super friendly for users as well.
